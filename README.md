Making an algorithm with the purpose of finding a path more optimally than the A* algorithm. This algorithm will be called the U* algorithm.

The main strategy for beating the algorithm is to go straight.

This experiment is made using the Unity game engine to visualize it and some code from CodeMonkey (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alU04hvz6L4&t=137s&pp=ygURY29kZSBtb25rZXkgYXN0YXI%3D)
